Additive Synthesis Assignment (HW1)

Uses additive synthesis to simulate different instruments (sine wave, flute, violin, oboe, clarinet, horn, trombone).  
The interpolate slider allows interpolation between any two of these instruments, with 0.0 (or left on the slider)
corresponding to the upper instrument bank, and 1.0 (right on the slider) corresponding the the lower instrument bank.
Instruments are playable from the on-screen keyboard GUI or selectable MIDI interface.
